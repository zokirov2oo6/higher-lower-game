⭐ Higher or Lower Game

A simple terminal game where you guess which person has more followers — A or B.
If you're right, your score goes up. If you're wrong, the game ends.

🎮 How It Works

Two random people (A and B) are shown from game_data.py.

You choose "A" or "B" based on who you think has more followers.

Correct → score +1 and B becomes the new A.

Wrong → game over + final score.

▶ Run the Game
python main.py

📁 Files
main.py       → game logic

🏁 Example Output
